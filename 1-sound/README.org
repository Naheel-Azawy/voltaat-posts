* Know it
  Do you have a project where you need to turn something on and off? Maybe use a switch and the problem is solved... But... Boring... How about controlling it by clapping!

  A sound sensor can be used for that like the one in the picture below. This sensor works by simple firing a signal at the D0 pin once the sound level is above a certain level. This level can be tuned by rotating the golden screw left and right until it's suitable for your surrounding.
