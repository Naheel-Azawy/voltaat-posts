* Know it
  Do you have a project where you need to turn something on and off? Maybe use a switch and the problem is solved... But... Boring... How about controlling it by clapping!

  A sound sensor can be used for that like the one in the picture below. This sensor works by simple firing a signal at the D0 pin once the sound level is above a certain level. This level can be tuned by rotating the golden screw left and right until it's suitable for your surrounding.

  The wiring here is a piece of cake! First, make sure you have the following below and connect is shown in the picture.

  - LED
  - 1K Ω resistor
  - Jumper wires
  - Arduino board and USB connector

  Connections:

  - Sound sensor G   → Arduino pin GND
  - Sound sensor +   → Arduino pin 5V
  - Sound sensor D0  → Arduino pin 2
  - LED              → Arduino pin 3
