#+TITLE: Build a mini weather station ☂️
#+AUTHOR: Naheel Faisal Kamal

* Know it
  To build our tiny weather station, a temperature and humidity sensor is needed. For our case, we will use the DHT11 sensor and connect it to an LCD screen to display the readings. This allows us to see the temperature and humidity and calculate the heat index. You can pick between Celsius and Fahrenheit too!

* Wire it
  Wiring is pretty straight forward thanks to the convenient interfaces. The needed components are:

  - Jumper wires and Breadboard
  - Arduino board and USB connector
  - DHT11 sensor
  - 16x2 LCD display with the I2C driver

  Connections from the Arduino to the breadboard:

  Arduino pin GND → Breadboard ground line
  Arduino pin 5V  → Breadboard 5V line

  Connections from the LCD I2C driver:

  LCD GND → Breadboard ground line
  LCD Vcc → Breadboard 5V line
  LCD SDA → Arduino pin A4
  LCD SCL → Arduino pin A5

  Connections from the DHT sensor:

  DHT GND    → Breadboard ground line
  DHT Vcc    → Breadboard 5V line
  DHT Signal → Arduino pin 2
